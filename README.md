## Author notes: This paper presents the state-of-art QRS complex detection algorithm. Therefore, I have tried to recreate the algorithm, however, I could not get the same performance as the paper did. If you find any error in the code, please let me know.
# The coding was done using Matlab 2018a
# A main function for loading the MIT-BIH database is required.
# The performance on MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database:
